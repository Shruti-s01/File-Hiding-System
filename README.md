A Java-based project called the File Hiding System with Secure Access and User Management was created to give users an effective and safe method of protecting their files. By enabling users to conceal files in a MySQL database and utilizing email OTP verification for multi-factor authentication, this project prioritizes privacy and data security.

• File Hiding and Encryption: The system enabled users to securely hide files by encrypting and storing them in a
centralized MySQL database, ensuring protection against unauthorized access.

• User Authentication with Multi-Factor Security: It incorporated robust user authentication mechanisms, including
email-based OTP verification during sign up and log-in, providing an additional layer of security through two-factor
authentication.

• Multi-User Support: The project supports multiple users with individual accounts, allowing for personalized and isolated
file management for each user.

• User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and accessible interface facilitated smooth navigation for users through sign-up,
log-in, file management, and profile settings.

• Java and MySQL Integration: The integration of Java with MySQL ensured efficient handling of data storage and
retrieval, resulting in a seamless user experience.

• File Retrieval with Decryption: Users can access and retrieve their hidden files from the database. Decryption ensured
that the files were restored to their original format for use.

• Profile and File Management Features: The dashboard allows users to manage their profiles, update passwords, and
organize their hidden files effectively.
